# Kitchen::Docker

A Test Kitchen Driver for Docker.

## Requirements

* [Docker][docker_getting_started]

## Known Issues

* Upstart is neutered due to [this issue][docker_upstart_issue].

## Installation and Setup

Please read the [Driver usage][driver_usage] page for more details.

Example `.kitchen.local.yml`:

```
---
driver_plugin: docker

platforms:
- name: ubuntu
  run_list:
  - recipe[apt]
- name: centos
  driver_config:
    image: "centos"
    platform: "rhel"
  run_list:
  - recipe[yum]
```

## Configuration

### image

The Docker image to use as the base for the suite containers. You can find
images using the [Docker Index][docker_index].

The default value is `base`, an official Ubuntu [image][docker_default_image].

### platform

The platform of the chosen image. This is used to properly bootstrap the
suite container for Test Kitchen. Kitchen Docker currently supports:

* `debian` or `ubuntu`
* `rhel` or `centos`

The default value is `ubuntu`.

### require\_chef\_omnibus

Determines whether or not a Chef [Omnibus package][chef_omnibus_dl] will be
installed. There are several different behaviors available:

* `true` - the latest release will be installed. Subsequent converges
  will skip re-installing if chef is present.
* `latest` - the latest release will be installed. Subsequent converges
  will always re-install even if chef is present.
* `<VERSION_STRING>` (ex: `10.24.0`) - the desired version string will
  be passed the the install.sh script. Subsequent converges will skip if
  the installed version and the desired version match.
* `false` or `nil` - no chef is installed.

The default value is `true`.

### remove\_images

This determines if images are automatically removed when the suite container is
destroyed.

The default value is `false`.

### memory

Sets the memory limit for the container. The value must be set in bytes.
If not, set it defaults to dockers default settings. You can read more about 
`memory.limit_in_bytes` [here][memory_limit_in_bytes].

### cpu

Sets the cpu shares (relative weight). If not set, it defaults to dockers
default settings. You can read more about cpu.shares [here][cpu_shares].

### volume

Adds a data volume to your container.

Examples:

```
volume: /ftp
```

```
volume:
- /ftp
- /srv
```

## dns

Adjusts `resolv.conf` to use the dns servers specified. Otherwise use
dockers defaults.

Examples:

```
dns: 8.8.8.8
```

```
dns:
- 8.8.8.8
- 8.8.4.4
```

### forward

Suite container port(s) to forward to the host machine. You may specify
the host (public) port in the mappings, if not, Docker chooses for you.

Examples:

```
forward: 80
```

```
forward:
- 22:2222
- 80:8080
```

## Development

* Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]
* Report issues/questions/feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]

Pull requests are very welcome! Make sure your patches are well tested.
Ideally create a topic branch for every separate change you make. For
example:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
